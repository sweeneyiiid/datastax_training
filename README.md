going through datastax training, want to keep some notes

# Setup for Exercises

Done through AWS, doc for setting up is on website, this is just for any additional notes/reminders.

 - ok, pretty basic EC2 setup, reference doc to search for their pre-setup image (note, I am in us-west-2)
 - selected t2.medium
 - leave defaults in instance details and storage
 - added tag datastax_training:not_sure_what_this_is
 - for security groups, for now, just allowing SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, may need to add more later (see doc for more details)
 - generated new key pair just for this
 - setup SSH with Putty, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html
 - verified, I am in
